# Eferno Documentation

This folder contains major milestone documentation for the Eferno project.

## Documents

- **[01-environment-setup.md](./01-environment-setup.md)** - Environment variables and MCP server testing
- More documents will be added as development progresses...

## Purpose

This documentation tracks major implementation steps and decisions for the Eferno AI Shopping Assistant app. Each document represents a significant milestone in the development process.

## Convention

Documents are numbered sequentially with descriptive names:
- `01-environment-setup.md`
- `02-database-setup.md`
- `03-ui-implementation.md`
- etc.

Only major steps are documented here to avoid clutter.
